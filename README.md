Twitter River Plugin for Elasticsearch
==================================

The Twitter river indexes the public [twitter stream](http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api), aka the hose,
and makes it searchable.

## Version 2.3.1-SNAPSHOT for Elasticsearch: 1.3

If you are looking for another version documentation, please refer to the 
[compatibility matrix](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-river-twitter/#twitter-river-plugin-for-elasticsearch).


Prerequisites
-------------

You need to get an OAuth token in order to use Twitter river.
Please follow [Twitter documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom), basically:

* Login to: https://dev.twitter.com/apps/
* Create a new Twitter application (let's say elasticsearch): https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new
You don't need a callback URL.
* When done, click on `Create my access token`.
* Open `OAuth tool` tab and note `Consumer key`, `Consumer secret`, `Access token` and `Access token secret`.


Create river
------------

Creating the twitter river can be done using:

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "oauth" : {
            "consumer_key" : "*** YOUR Consumer key HERE ***",
            "consumer_secret" : "*** YOUR Consumer secret HERE ***",
            "access_token" : "*** YOUR Access token HERE ***",
            "access_token_secret" : "*** YOUR Access token secret HERE ***"
        }
    },
    "index" : {
        "index" : "my_twitter_river",
        "type" : "status",
        "bulk_size" : 100,
        "flush_interval" : "5s"
    }
}
```

The above lists all the options controlling the creation of a twitter river.

If you don't define `index.index`, it will use your river name (`my_twitter_river`) as the default index name.
If you don't define `index.type`, default `status` type will be used. 

Note that you can define any or all of your oauth settings in `elasticsearch.yml` file on each node by prefixing 
setting with `river.twitter.`:

```
river.twitter.oauth.consumer_key: "*** YOUR Consumer key HERE ***"
river.twitter.oauth.consumer_secret: "*** YOUR Consumer secret HERE ***"
river.twitter.oauth.access_token: "*** YOUR Access token HERE ***"
river.twitter.oauth.access_token_secret: "*** YOUR Access token secret HERE ***"
```

In that case, you can create the river using:

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter"
}
```

You can also overload any of `elasticsearch.yml` setting. A good practice could be to have `consumer_key` and 
`consumer_secret` in `elasticsearch.yml` and provide to the river `access_token` and `access_token_secret` properties.

By default, the twitter river will read a small random of all public statuses using
[sample API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/sample).

But, you can define statuses type you want to read:

* [sample](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/sample): the default one
* [filter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/filter): track for text, users and locations.
See [Filtered Stream](#filtered-stream)
* [user](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/user): listen to tweets in the authenticated user's timeline.
See [User Stream](#user-stream)
* [firehose](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/firehose): all public statuses (restricted access)

For example:

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "type" : "firehose"
    }
}
```

Note that if you define a filter (see [next section](#filtered-stream)), type will be automatically set to `filter`.

Tweets will be indexed once a `bulk_size` of them have been accumulated (default to `100`)
or every `flush_interval` period (default to `5s`).

Filtered Stream
===============

Filtered stream can also be supported (as per the twitter stream API). Filter stream can be configured to
support `tracks`, `follow`, `locations` and `language`. `userlists` is a shortcut to follow all members of a public twitter list identified by the user id and the list slug (last part of uri when open a list in your browser). The configuration is the same as the twitter API (a single comma
separated string value, or using json arrays). Here is an example:

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "filter" : {
            "tracks" : "test,something,please",
            "follow" : "111,222,333",
            "userlists" : "ownerScreenName1/slug1,ownerScreenName2/slug2",
            "locations" : "-122.75,36.8,-121.75,37.8,-74,40,-73,41",
            "language" : "fr,en"
        }
    }
}
```

Note that locations use geoJSON order (longitude, latitude).

Note that if you want to use language filtering you need also to define at least one of `tracks`,
`follow` or `locations` filter.
Supported languages identifiers are [BCP 47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). You can filter
whatever language defined in [Twitter Advanced Search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced).

Here is an array based configuration example:

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "filter" : {
            "tracks" : ["test", "something"],
            "follow" : [111, 222, 333],
            "locations" : [ [-122.75,36.8], [-121.75,37.8], [-74,40], [-73,41]],
            "language" : [ "fr", "en" ]
        }
    }
}
```

User Stream
===========

User stream can also be supported (as per the twitter stream API). This stream return tweets on the authenticated user's
timeline. Here is a basic configuration example:

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "type" : "user"
    }
}
```

Indexing RAW Twitter stream
===========================

By default, elasticsearch twitter river will convert tweets to an equivalent representation
in elasticsearch. If you want to index RAW twitter JSON content without any transformation,
you can set `raw` to `true`:

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "raw" : true
    }
}
```

Note that you should think of creating a mapping first for your tweets. See Twitter documentation on
[raw Tweet format](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets):

```
PUT my_twitter_river/status/_mapping
{
    "status" : {
        "properties" : {
            "text" : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "standard"}
        }
    }
}
```

Ignoring Retweets
=================

If you don't want to index retweets (aka RT), just set `ignore_retweet` to `true` (default to `false`):

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "ignore_retweet" : true
    }
}
```

Geo location points as array
============================

By default, elasticsearch twitter river index `location` field using the *lat lon as properties* format.
You can set `geo_as_array` to `true` if you prefer having `location` indexed as an array `[lon, lat]`.

```
PUT _river/my_twitter_river/_meta
{
    "type" : "twitter",
    "twitter" : {
        "geo_as_array" : true
    }
}
```

Remove the river
================

If you need to stop the Twitter river, you have to remove it:

```
DELETE _river/my_twitter_river/
```

Tests
=====

Integrations tests in this plugin require working Twitter account and therefore disabled by default. 
You need to create your credentials as explained in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

To enable tests prepare a config file `elasticsearch.yml` with the following content:

```
river:
  twitter:
      oauth:
         consumer_key: "your_consumer_key"
         consumer_secret: "your_consumer_secret"
         access_token: "your_access_token"
         access_token_secret: "your_access_token_secret"
```

Replace all occurrences of `your_consumer_key`, `your_consumer_secret`, `your_access_token` and 
`your_access_token_secret` with your settings.

To run test:

```sh
mvn -Dtests.twitter=true -Dtests.config=/path/to/config/file/elasticsearch.yml clean test
```

Note that if you want to test User Stream, you need to define write rights for your twitter 
application.
